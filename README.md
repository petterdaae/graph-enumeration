# Enumeration and vizualisation of undirected and directed graphs

To show how much richer the space of directed graphs are than the space of undirected graphs is, this notebook enumerates all non-isomorphic undirected and directed graphs and vizualises them. Below is the vizualisation of all directed graphs of size 4.
