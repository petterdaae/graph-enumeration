# Enumeration of undirected and directed graphs

To show how much richer the space of directed graphs are than the space of undirected graphs is, this notebook enumerates all simple non-isomorphic undirected and directed graphs and vizualises them. Below is the vizualisation of all directed graphs of size 4.
